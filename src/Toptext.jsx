      Hello Girlfriend, 
      Happy Six Months. I hope you don't look at this website and think about what a perfect metaphor it is for our relationship- better in the first half with serious corners
      being cut in the second. I kid. Obviously. Every day with you has been even better than the last and reenforces how lucky I am to have you. I hope the metaphor you see here is in 
      the raw, HTML unabated by fancy CSS, and is true to its form is just like me. I am running out of room and because I have forgotten how to resize text I must make these final words count. 
      My heart skips a beat everytime I see you. You are undoubtedly the most kind, insightful and beautiful person I have ever had the great pleasre of meeting. Please know that I 
      am thinking of your warmly from my side of the planet and that I look forward to seeing you again. git 
      :) 
    </p>
